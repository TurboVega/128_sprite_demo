# 128_sprite_demo
Demo of moving 128 sprites for Commander X16

This is the first part of a larger demo, where I intend to try handling
collision detection with 128 sprites involved. This particular repository
holds only code that shows 128 sprites moving in concentric elliptical
paths (that I called rings). There is no collision detection
in this code.

Shout out to Matt Heffernan for his X16 tutorials and sample code!
